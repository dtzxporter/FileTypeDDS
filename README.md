# FileTypeDDS
A less shitty DDS plugin for Paint.NET

*Read and soon write DDS files, extremely fast, in your favorite image editor.*

- Read just about any DDS file (Including modern ones!)
- Write to over 50 different DDS formats
- Fast performance, easy to use installer

## Installation:

Download the latest [Release.zip](https://github.com/dtzxporter/FileTypeDDS/releases) and extract the archive.

Next, launch `FileTypeDDSInstaller.exe` and run as admin if prompted to do so. Click `install` and wait, this will only take a few moments.

You may now launch Paint.NET and open a DDS file.

## Notes:

When Paint.NET has an update, you `must` re-run the installer, it will ensure that the plugin is up-to-date and ready to go.

This plugin is provided as-is with no warranty provided. Use at your own risk.

Wanna help? Send a message to `Rick Brewster` over at [https://forums.getpaint.net/](https://forums.getpaint.net/) asking for the ability to override default filetypes via plugins! This will make it easier to use our custom DDS plugin, without the need for an installer!
